Thus, make up brands and companies have an important responsibility of creating products that are inclusive. Although there are many different types of make up products, many brands have faced angry responses from customers for their restricted range of shades for foundations especially. In an Insider article written in 2018, the author talks about how brands like YSL, BeautyBlender, and Tarte have faced backlash for not having a diverse range of shades for their customers. Foundation is frequently used to create an even color to the complexion and to cover flaws, which means it&#39;s not a one-size-fits-all type of product. As someone with an interest in beauty/cosmetics and who uses foundations on a daily basis, I wanted to take this opportunity to educate myself in the problems and biases embedded within one of the most commonly used make up products. Thus, I focus my project on exploring implications of racial disparities behind foundation shades through a few different lenses such as their shade range, numerical labeling system, and categorical labels. . Questions . Are there any racial disparities in the range and variety of foundation shades? | Is there a trend in the labeling system that reflects racial bias? | How diverse is the language in labeling different shades? | METHODS . Data . This data was provided by the digital publication company &#39;The Pudding&#39;. The Github repository includes a number of datasets, but the ones used for the purpose of this project were &#39;allCategories&#39;, &#39;allNumbers&#39;, &#39;allShades&#39;. The data were collected from US Sephora and Ulta&#39;s websites on January 11 and January 18, 2021, respectively. Any products available on both Sephora and Ulta’s websites were consolidated, and Ulta’s version of the product was used. &#39;allCategories&#39; csv file includes a dataset of foundation shades that used a word-based labelling system and their categories. The labels of shades were manually assigned to 16 categories. &#39;allNumbers&#39; csv file includes a dataset of foundation products from Sephora and Ulta’s US websites that use a number-based labelling system. Utilizing all of the number labels from a single product line, they determined whether the numbers were sequential (i.e., there were no repeated numbers) or the same number could be used for multiple shades in the same line. For sequential products, the data shows whether the products were organized from light to dark or dark to light. &#39;allShades&#39; csv file includes a dataset of color information from each foundation swatch. Hex values and lightness were extracted from the featured swatches on the website using the jpeg, magick, and imager packages in R. . Include how they got the data (what is represented in the data, what&#39;s missing from the data that I think it&#39;s important) . Terms to Know . Lightness: The lightness value from the HSL color space. This is represented as a decimal from 0 to 1 where 0 is pure black and 1 is pure white. Categories: Manually assigned categories for labels of foundation shades. Numbers: The numbers associated with a particular shade. . Shades . Below are images of shades that vary in lightness from 0.2 to 0.9 for reference. I extracted the Hex values of foundation shades that vary in lightness from 0.2 to 0.9, and used the website &quot;https://www.colorhexa.com/&quot; in order to retrieve the image of that Hex value. . from IPython import display .

The boxplots above show that &#39;Clinique&#39; has the widest range of shades while &#39;Black Up&#39; has the narrowest range of shades. Brands such as &#39;Clinique&#39;, &#39;Sephora Collection&#39;, &#39;Tarte&#39;, &#39;bareMinerals&#39; offer a wide variety of shades, while brands such as &#39;Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare&#39;, &#39;Marc Jacobs Beauty&#39; only offer limited range of shades. . Trends in Labeling System . When things are numbered or arranged in sequence, number one tends to hold meaning of being more &quot;important&quot; or &quot;relevant&quot; due to the inherent nature of being the first number. The author of the article &quot;Naked Truth&quot; states that, &quot;When beauty brands label their foundation shades with sequential numbers, they are implicitly prioritizing those at the beginning of the sequence.&quot; Additionally, the numbering system affects the accessibility of certain shades as online websites tend to hide shades that are labeled with higher numbers behind the &quot;see more&quot; button. I wanted to explore if there is a noticeable pattern in the numerical labeling system in foundation shades. . count = numbersdf[&#39;lightToDark&#39;].sum() count . 2852 . Out of 3117 shades, 2852 shades are organized in a sequential way from light to dark. . Line Plot of Lightness and Numbering System . n = numbersdf[[&#39;lightness&#39;, &#39;numbers&#39;]].groupby(&#39;numbers&#39;).mean() n.plot(figsize = (40,5)) plt.axhline(y = 0.634, color = &#39;r&#39;) . &lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f080f144a60&gt; . This x-axis of this plot shows the numbers that are used when labeling their shades. The y-axis of this plot shows the lightness of a shade. For example, if a brand labels its lighter shades as lower numbers and darker shades as higher numbers, that would indicate that the brand organized the shades from lighter to darker shades. As the graph shows, most of the higher numbers are used to label darker shades. .

There is a weak negative correlation between &#39;lightness&#39; and &#39;numbers&#39;, which somewhat confirms that the higher the lightness, the lower the number used to label the shade. However, the correlation is not strong enough to conclude there is a definite trend in which lighter shades are labeled first. .

DISCUSSION . Analytical Process . While analyzing the datasets, I went through a few trials and errors. Initially, I chose the point of distinction between lighter and darker shades as 0.5 simply because it was the middle number in the lightness range that spans from 0 to 1. However, I realized that there were no foundation shades that were 0 and 1 as they are black and white, respectively. Thus, I chose to use the mean of the shades that are included in the dataset as the point of distinction. I also thought about using the median, but median is not good at capturing outliers relative to mean, and the two measures were not much different from each other. . I also initially made a visualization which showed the mean shade of each brand with the hopes of seeing hy I removed the bar plot about mean shades of foundation . Range and Variety . The histogram of lightness with the two tallest peaks that fall under the category of lighter shades indicates that shades with lightness values between 0.7 and 0.8 are most available and accessible. In terms of brands and their shade ranges, Clinique offered the widest range of shades with lightness values that range from 0.3 to higher than 0.9. Tarte, bareMinerals, and MAC also offered a variety of shades. For brands that had the least number of shades such as Black Up, COOLA, KIKO Milano and Marc Jacobs Beauty, it was interesting to see that brands such as Marc Jacobs Beauty and Black Up offered a restricted range of shades that all fell under the category of darker shades. This went against my preconceived notion that if a brand only had a restricted range of shades, it would only offer shades catered towards lighter shades. Even though brands such as Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare only offered lighter shades, there were brands that only offered darker shades as well. . Numbering System . Although 2852 out of 3117 shades were organized from light to dark, this doesn’t immediately translate to a definite pattern of sequential labeling system. One product line that labels shades from light to dark way may have a very wide range of shades that constitute a big part of 3117 shades. The correlation between the variables lightness and numbers were -.26 which is not a strong correlation. Therefore, it is hard to conclude that there is a definite trend in the numerical labeling system that reflects racial bias. . Variability of Labels . Overall, the histograms showed that lighter shades were labeled with a variety of different categories. Out of the 16 categories, 10 categories were most frequently used to label a shade with lightness values that fell under the category of a lighter shade. Meanwhile, the language for labeling darker shades was relatively restricted. They were most frequently labeled using drinks, metal and wood. This shows that the language in labeling darker shades is not as diverse as the language to describe lighter shades. . Additionally, categories that inherently have positive connotations such as ‘compliment’ or ‘gem’ were more frequently used for lighter shades than darker shades. Especially, gems were used to label 368 lighter shades, while they were used to label 84 darker shades. This result implies an implicit bias in attitudes towards lighter versus darker shades. . In all, the data showed that even though the most available and accessible foundation shades are lighter shades, there are a lot of available options for darker shades as well. When it came to labeling the shades, however, data suggests that the language is quite limited when it comes to labeling darker shades relative to lighter shades, which shows there is a lack of creativity and variability for darker shade labels. Additionally, lighter shades are labeled with words that have positive connotation noticeably more than the darker shades. In terms of the numbering system, there seems to be a weak pattern of labeling shades from light to dark. These results suggest that the current selection of foundations in the US market seems to have improved in terms of shade range but definitely has room for improvement regarding the language used to label the shades. . Moving Forward . I hope that this project provided a bit of statistical insight into the bias that still exists within foundation shades and wish that it contributes to the process of bringing awareness to people regarding this issue. As mentioned in the beginning of this project, Tarte previously received angry backlash from their customers for their shade range. However, the dataset used for this project was created in 2021, and the numbers show that Tarte is now one of the brands that has the widest selection of shades. As such, many brands have acknowledged their shortcomings with their limited shade range and have improved upon their make up products. Moving forward, I hope to see make up brands and companies expanding their ways of labeling darker shades and become more creative instead of relying on their go-to categories such as metal and drink-related terms. .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
